# Firebase Database Access Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access the database before it's fully initialized.  The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected implementation.

**Problem:** Asynchronous operations with Firebase can cause issues if database methods are called before the database is ready. This often results in errors or unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**  Use appropriate lifecycle methods (like `ngOnInit` in Angular) or promises to ensure the database is ready before accessing it.
